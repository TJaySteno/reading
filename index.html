				<h2>Merry Christmas, Nathaniel and Ethan!</h2>
				<p>This website is a way for me to help you two crazy kids learn how to read! You can learn your ABCs so you can show tia Debbie how cool you are or learn how to sound out letters to tell grandpa and grandma what "c-a-t" sounds like. If you promise to practice a lot, I will even add more things later on and before long you will be reading all of this to your mom and dad.</p>
				<p><strong>So where do you want to start?</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="./alphabet.html">Alphabet Soup</a> is the cool way to learn your alphabet! It has a picture of an awesome Star Wars ship or character for every letter.</li>
					<li><a href="./sounds.html">Sound It Out!</a> helps you learn what sounds letters make, also known as phonemic recognition. Have your mom, dad, or some other super cool adult read what sound each letter makes.</li>
				</ul>
