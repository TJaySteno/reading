## Reading App

*This project is a tool for my nephews to help them learn how to read. The goal is to have a webpage that can, in many cases, be used with or without parental help that will help a child learn at every stage of the process; from understanding sounds of letters up through being able to read fluently.*

### Alphabet Soup

The first page I will implement will be a tool to help the child learn the alphabet. Since my nephews like Star Wars (and this, of course is an interest I want to encourage), this will be the theme. I will find pictures of various Star Wars characters and associate them will letters. (A is for Admiral Ackbar, B is for Bossk, C is for Chewie, etc). So if the child is learning 'L', there will be a picture of Luke Skywalker, below will be text stating 'L is for Luke', and finally a button that moves on to the next letter. The default setting will be to go through A to Z, but a user will also be able to select which letter they want to start on and begin the cycle from there.

### Positive Reinforcement

I believe the best way to teach a child (and anyone for that matter) is through positive reinforcement. Therefore, once a few basics features of the site are up and running, I will figure out a method for achieving this. Maybe let the parent give them a rank when they understand a task letting them slowing level up to Jedi Knight or something. I'm not sure yet, I'll think about it.
